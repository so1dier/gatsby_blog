In the time of pandemic I decided to learn new things. Creating a blog was something I really wanted to do before the pandemic started, but I never could find the time to do it.

Today I found the time to create a starter blog with gatsby. I am using it in the develop mode, and planning to deploy the blog when I find the host.

I want to use this blog to show what I learn from each day. My plans ahead are:

1. Brush up on Data structures and algorithms
2. Share thoughts on books
3. Give my view on movies
4. Have a diary on what I am learning about each month


I hope I will get to fill a lot of this as often as possible...
